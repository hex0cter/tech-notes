# [Static DNS and IP address allocation](http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-491711.html)

Open network configuration file
`$ sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces` or `$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`

Find and remove dhcp entry:
`iface eth0 inet dhcp`

Append new network settings:

```
  iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.1.100
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  network 192.168.1.0
  broadcast 192.168.1.255
  gateway 192.168.1.254`
```

Edit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
···
gksu gedit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
···
put your numbers, looks like this->

`prepend domain-name-servers 208.67.220.220, 208.67.222.222;`

(that setup is if you wanted to use opendns)

And restart the network manager, then check the result:
```
  daniel@daniel-laptop:/etc$ cat resolv.conf
  # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
  # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN

  daniel@daniel-laptop:/etc$
```
