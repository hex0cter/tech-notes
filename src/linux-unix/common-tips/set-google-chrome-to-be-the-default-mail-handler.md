# [Set Google Chrome to be the Default Mail Handler](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/going-google/helpdesk-reps/set-google-chrome-to-be-the-default-mail-handler)


When you click on an email link in a Web page or email message, your computer will open a new compose window with the email address in the To: line. The program used to compose the message is determined by the Default Mail Handler for your computer.

You can set Google Chrome to be the default mail handler in a couple ways.
## From Your Address Bar
When you first log in to your M+Google Mail account, you’ll see a double-diamond icon in your address bar:

Clicking this icon opens a menu:
Menu with three choices for what the default mail handler should be: Use University of Michigan Mail, No, and Ignore
Choose Use University of Michigan Mail and then click Done. Chrome will now open a new compose window whenever you click on an email link.
## From Google Chrome Settings
If you don’t see the double-diamond icon in your Address bar, you can set the default mail handler in your Google Chrome settings.

From the The Google Chrome menu icon menu, choose Settings (or Preferences, depending on your operating system).
At the bottom of the Settings page, click Show advanced settings.
In the Privacy section, click Content settings. A new window opens.
In the Handlers section, click Manage handlers. The Protocol handlers window opens.
In the mailto section, choose University of Michigan Mail from the dropdown list.
