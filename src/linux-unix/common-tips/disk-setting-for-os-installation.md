# "Error - No hard disks were found for the installation. Please check your hardware"

To resolve the problem of "Error - No hard disks were found for the installation. Please check your hardware" while the installation of OpenSUSE, below action should be tried:


* Installation --ACPI Disabled
* Installation --Local APIC Disabled
* Installation --Safe Settings

The first configuration just resolved my problem.
