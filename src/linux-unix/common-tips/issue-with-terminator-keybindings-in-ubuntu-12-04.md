# [Issue with Terminator keybindings in Ubuntu 12.04](http://codissimo.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/issue-with-terminator-keybindings-in-ubuntu-12-04/)

If Terminator keybindings with Ctrl-something are not working for you, itâ€™s due to a bug.

Until it is fixed, you can edit your ~/.config/terminator/config and replace <Primary> by <Ctrl>.
