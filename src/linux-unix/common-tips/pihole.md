 ** _Foreword_** _: I‚Äôm fascinated by technology and I wanted to share my
findings while expirementing with Pihole. I‚Äôm not personally against
advertisement companies as long as they‚Äôre not too intrusive. Pihole is
advertised as an ad blocker, but it‚Äôs actually an amazing tool for protecting
your own network from malwares and so on. I also keep my blog updated with new
articles with my consulting company, you can check at_[
_https://cdcloudlogix.com/blog_](https://cdcloudlogix.com/blog) _for more
information :)_

## I. Requirement and installation

tarting point of our journey, I will cover this part really quickly as you can
find many guideline online for installing Pihole.

I‚Äôm ersonally using Pihole installed on a **Raspberry pi** , I gave a fixed
private IP on my network where I‚Äôm redirecting all my DNS queries. You need to
have some basic knowledge of Linux command lines for installing Pihole, here is
a link to the official documentation from [Raspberry
pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/terminal/) on how to operate
the Terminal.

If you have some experience using Terminal, you can then start Pihole
installation by simply using:

This command will proceed automatically to this installation. For more
information and guidelines, have a look on the [official Pihole
documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/basic-install/).

## II. Pihole Dashboard

nother part I will cover quickly, Pihole Dashboard is rather self explanatory.
Once you completed the previous installation in part I, open your fav browser
the following address:

Dashboard

The password for _login_ tab is randomised and given after the installation in
your terminal, you can always reset it by using in your terminal:

You will then be presented with this detailed dashboard:

dashboard

This Dashboardwould allow to access _most_ of the Pihole controls such as DHCP,
DNS configuration and so on as well as reloading the configuration. Dashboard
does help troubleshooting and visualising the global amount of dns request
traffic, something you will need once we unlock the full potential of Pihole by
using the command line in the next following parts.

## III. Community filter lists

irst step to make the most of your new toy would be to utilise the list of
filtered domains already gathered by the community. The website
[filterlists.com](https://filterlists.com/) contains the primary main elements
for helping you to block:

  * Spyware domains
  * Malware domains
  * Coinmining networks
  * Ransomware domains
  * Phishing domains
  * Trackers and Analyticals domains

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*kGXquHahYGTVe1wkjXf5SQ.png)Pihole logo is
displayed when the filter is compatible with Pihole

To implement one of the filter, select the one you‚Äôd like to use and right click
on the link _‚Äú üîé View‚Äù_ and select _Copy link location._ From there, open your
terminal and paste this URL in the _/etc/pihole/adlists.list_ file. Once
completed, reload Pihole configuration by using pihole -g command. Here is an
example of the output of this command:

These external filter list are maintained and updated some time to time, I would
advise to make use of a [Cron job](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-
us/articles/215767047-Creating-a-custom-Cron-Job) in order to keep these list up
to date by using the above command on a weekly basis.

As a starting point, here is my list of filters implemented on my personnal
Pihole:

## IV. Dynamic DNS naming

or fun and to challenge myself, I wanted to understand how to block Youtube ads
on my AmazonFireTV. Youtube streaming service is using ‚Äú _.googlevideo.com‚Äù_ as
the main domain name for videos as well as for ads.

Many have been trying and for quite sometime to recognise the pattern used by
Youtube to inject Advertisement, (check this [Discourse pihole thread
](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-block-ads-on-youtube/253)started in
2016) and here is little documentation on **_How to do_** this.

 **Update** : Youtube Ads are no longer blocked by this method, Youtube
integrates their ads within the same stream of data (which means blocking ads
with DNS naming is no longer working. There‚Äôs perhaps another solution using a
proxy for all of your HTTPS traffic that would be decrypt your secure traffic on
the flight and denied ads traffic. It does require root access to phone / apps.
Some solutions out there are avaible but you end up sending all your sensitive
traffic to _who knows where_. At the end, I just use webapps (different from
mobile app) on my phone where I keep control of my data and can deny Ads Traffic
;)

  1.  **Add Python3 and pip on your pihole device**

Install them this way:

Link python3 to your user environment:

Verify:

 **2\. Make use of Sublist3r script:**

Create a folder for hosting this [Github
repo](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r/)(Instructions are also present
there):

Download and unzip this project:

This script will help us to retrieve dynamic subdomains created and generated by
youtube (googlevideo in this case). I used to get these subdomain by using
DNSDumpster but that was limited to only 100 domains (thank you to my readers
for pointing that out). With this method, you should get routhly around 700+
subdomains.

 **3\. Final script to implement the magic:**

Sublist3r would also require some packages to be installed alongside,
(instructions are also on Github), install them as follow

You should be able to test this script this way:

Now, I‚Äôm using this script for filtering the desired traffic and adding this to
my blacklist file in Pihole (script path: _/etc/pihole/youtube-ads.sh_ ):

This script is divided in several parts:

  * Retrieve subdomains from Sublist3r
  * Filter them, place findings in blacklist file and curate the results.
  * Use a `xargs` pipe to populate pihole db based on finding

I‚Äôm running this twice a hour with a cronjob (don‚Äôt forget to make this script
**executable** with _chmod_ ):

This configuration has been running for a while and I do have some time some ads
on my FireTV or Youtube App on my phone. Overtime, the cronjob would collect
subdomains and add them to your pihole file, which would limit the number of ads
you‚Äôd be expose to.

Feel free to contact me if you want to share your ideas.

## V. Regex blacklisting

inal part of this publication, you can also leverage the use of implementing a
list of regex matching the domain names that you wish to deny.

I _used_ to make use of that in the past with previous versions of Pihole,
somehow, **blacklisted domains** redirected to a **whitelisted CNAME** were
actually bypassing Pihole. I‚Äôm not having anymore this issue in Pihole **version
5.1** :

Previously, the only way for blocking this traffic was actually the use of
Regex, by simply a list of pattern in this _/etc/pihole/regex.list_ file. Here
is an example:

## VI. What next?

I will keep this publication up to date with the latest. Things keep moving
fast, especially the new implementations such as [DNS over
HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) and I wonder how Pihole
would involve and adapt with this technology.
