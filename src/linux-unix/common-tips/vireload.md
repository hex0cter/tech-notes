# [How do I reload/re-edit the current file with vim? - Daniel Han's Technical Notes](https://sites.google.com/site/xiangyangsite/home/technical-tips/linux-unix/common-tips/vireload)

You can use the ":edit" command, without specifying a file name, to reloadthe current file. If you have made modifications to the file, you can use":edit!" to force the reload of the current file (you will lose yourmodifications).For more information, read:help :edit:help :edit!:help 'confirm'http://stevemorin.blogspot.com/2005/11/vim-vi-how-to-reload-file-your-editing.html
