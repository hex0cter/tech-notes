# [Install oracle client on CentOS - Daniel Han's Technical Notes](https://sites.google.com/site/xiangyangsite/home/technical-tips/linux-unix/centos/install-oracle-client-on-centos)

Oracle client for Linux seems working perfectly for CentOS.

See details on http://hewiki.heroengine.com/wiki/Oracle_Client_Installation:_CentOS

I successfully installed oracle 11g2r on my CentOS 6.4 following those instructions. Here is an updated script you need to run before start the installer.
