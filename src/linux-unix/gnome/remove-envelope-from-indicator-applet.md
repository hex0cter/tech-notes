# [Remove envelope from indicator applet](http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1461111.html)


If you want the "envelope" gone, remove the indicator-messages package,and keep indicator-sound (which is for the volume) and indicator-application installed.

Don't remove indicator-applet, which is the host applet that all of the above plug into.
