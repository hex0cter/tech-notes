Your name and email address were configured automatically based

on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.

You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

git commit --amend --reset-author
