***** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK *** **I‚Äôll not take responsibility for anything happen to you or your account****

***** THIS APP IS FOR ROOTED DEVICES ONLY *****

## What is this?

**Market Helper** is a tool for Android that helps users to be able to change/fake their rooted devices to any other devices. For example, it can turn your **Nexus 7** into **Samsung Galaxy S3** in a few seconds. No reboot is required.

## Why do I need to use this?

To download and install incompatible apps from Android Market / Google Play Market on your devices. For example, if you want to install Viber on your Nexus 7, switch it to Samsung Galaxy S3 and you‚Äôll can. Or if you change your DPI value, you‚Äôll find this app very useful.

( I‚Äôll update this section later ;P )

## Why is this app awesome?

‚Äì It **DOES NOT** touch your **build.prop** or any system files so it‚Äôs easier and safer.

‚Äì You don‚Äôt have to reboot the device to update the change.

‚Äì You can switch back your device to original state anytime, by using ‚ÄúRestore‚Äù feature or simply by rebooting your device ( with wifi/3g is enabled )

‚Äì Totally free

## Download link

I do not upload this app to the Google Play Store or anywhere else. It‚Äôs only available here, on this blog, for free

[Market Helper 2.0.4](https://goo.gl/rwsl1N) ( 2016/01/28 )

Supports: Android 2.3+ devices with Android Market / Google Play Store + Google Services Framework installed

Tested on Nexus 7 and Samsung Galaxy S3, running JellyBean 4.1.2

‚≠êÔ∏è Please checkout my new app: [Mauf ‚Äì Custom Messenger Colors](http://mauf.me)

[![Change Facebook Messenger conversation's color to any colors you want](https://i2.wp.com/codekiem.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/widget.png?resize=668%2C135)](http://mauf.me)Change Facebook Messenger conversation‚Äôs color to any colors you want. No root needed.

4\. IMPORTANT: go to [**Android Device Manager**](https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager) **** to update the change ( just visit the page, you don‚Äôt need to do anything ). I‚Äôll find a way to bypass this step in later versions

5\. Have fun. Now you can download apps that you couldn‚Äôt before.

If you want to switch back to normal, select ‚ÄúRestore‚Äù in device list and press ‚ÄúActivate‚Äù, or simply reboot the device ( with wifi/3g is enabled )

Please keep in mind that you can install incompatible apps doesn‚Äôt mean that those apps will 100% work on your device, so **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE** don‚Äôt go to Google Play Store and complain about it on the comment section or email the developer. I‚Äôm a developer too and I really hate when it happens. Thanks üôÇ

## Why does this app require so many permissions?

I know some of you will ask this question, so I‚Äôll explain it.

‚Äì **android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE** ( read phone status and identity ) : get your phone operator

‚Äì **android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** ( modify or delete the contents of your USB Storage + Test access to protected storage ) : read and write files on your external storage ( sdcard )

‚Äì **android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE + android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE + android.permission.INTERNET** ( full network access ) : access the internet

‚Äì **android.permission.AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS + android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS + android.permission.USE_CREDENTIALS** ( create accounts and set passwords + find accounts on the device + use accounts on the device ) : find current account on your device

‚Äì **com.google.android.providers.gsf.permission.READ_GSERVICES** ( read Google service configuration ) : get your authentication token for two services C2DM and ANDROIDMARKET. Those tokens will be used for checking in

If you still have questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask.
