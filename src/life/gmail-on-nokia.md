**Before you start** :
* We _strongly recommend_ that you back up any data from your phone using the Nokia PC Suite or other phone management software.
* You'll also need to make sure that your phone is compatible with Mail for Exchange and that you've downloaded the [latest version](http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138784).

To configure the Mail for Exchange application for Google Sync, follow these steps:

  1. Open the **MfE folder** on your phone and start the **Mail for Exchange** application.
  2. Select **Yes** when prompted to create a new Sync profile.
