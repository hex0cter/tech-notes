They're open and save dialogs. You navigate to a file or folder. You select it. You enter a file name when saving. You click Open or Save. How much more efficient can you get? Well, here are 10 things most Mac users probably don't know...

 **Tip 1:** Drag and drop a file or a folder right from the Finder into the open or save dialog to quickly select it. If you do this in a save dialog with a file, then the file's name is automatically entered as the save name.
